Data Preprocessing
Next step is to set up the data generators that will read pictures in the source folders, convert them to float32 tensors, and feed them (with their labels) to the model. You'll have one generator for the training images and one for the validation images. These generators will yield batches of images of size 300x300 and their labels (binary).

As you may already know, data that goes into neural networks should usually be normalized in some way to make it more amenable to processing by the network (i.e. It is uncommon to feed raw pixels into a ConvNet.) In this case, you will preprocess the images by normalizing the pixel values to be in the [0, 1] range (originally all values are in the [0, 255] range).

In Keras, this can be done via the keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator class using the rescale parameter. This ImageDataGenerator class allows you to instantiate generators of augmented image batches (and their labels) via .flow(data, labels) or .flow_from_directory(directory).


from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# All images will be rescaled by 1./255
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255)

# Flow training images in batches of 128 using train_datagen generator
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        './horse-or-human/',  # This is the source directory for training images
        target_size=(300, 300),  # All images will be resized to 300x300
        batch_size=128,
        # Since we use binary_crossentropy loss, we need binary labels
        class_mode='binary')
